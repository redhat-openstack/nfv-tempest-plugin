When I was creating testcases for lacp I also had this testcase in the same way and what I was told by Hekai Wang which test OVS: Downing a port at the kernel level does not properly test fail-over.\nMaybe, we should try to put the port down in the switch.\nIn any case, if OVS team are already testing this scenario, should we test it again?",
