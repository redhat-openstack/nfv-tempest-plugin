      "message": "Hi Miguel,\n\nThis patch is currently WIP.\nSo about multiple subnets, even though they are on the same network, a proper routing must exist in order to pass traffic between them.\nWhile in some tests we are configuring the routing in the guest, I think (don\u0027t remember) that it is done after this method.\nSo as of now, a network with a single subnet is our most common use case.",
