      "message": "Ella,\nWhat is the reason for that change?\n\nThe \"self.remote_ssh_sec_groups\" and \"self.remote_ssh_sec_groups_names\" created here - https://github.com/redhat-openstack/nfv-tempest-plugin/blob/master/nfv_tempest_plugin/tests/scenario/baremetal_manager.py#L862-L865.\n\nThe reason for those two class variables, is the way, how some of the processes are working.\nWhen some rule needs to be added to a security group, a security group id is required and here the \"self.remote_ssh_sec_groups\" var holds both name and id of the sec group.\nWhen an instance spawned, the nova api accepts only sec group name and fails if id of sec group provided.\n\nThe reason, that the id of the sec group is not removed before instance creation, is the following use case:\n\nA test creates for resources with specific security group.\nPerforming some tasks.\nAnd then need to spawn additional instances.\nIn order to be able to use the same security group and connection between the instances, the security group name needs to be available in any time during the test.",
