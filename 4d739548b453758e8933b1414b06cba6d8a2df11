One way to create default and custom sec groups.\n\nBut when you removed this block of code, it created a problem.\nThe instance will be created without security group attached.\nThe instance will be access because of the security group, but once the \"sec_group\" flag will be set to false, the instance will have no access.\n\nRemember that self.sec_groups and self.sec_groups_names created to be able to create resources later with the same sec groups.",
